Tried many different datasets and ways of processing the data like which columns to use for training the model, whether or not I should delete the rows/columns 
with a lot of NaN values, what ratio I should split the dataset in for training and testing, which scaling fuction to use etc.
I also tried different ML models for training like Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost before finally settling on Neural Networks because it gave the best accuracy.
Tried a variety of diffferent combinations for the neural network to try and improve accuracy.
