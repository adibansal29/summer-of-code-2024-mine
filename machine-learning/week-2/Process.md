Did a lot of data processing before deciding to predict the future sales in 3 different categories. Tried MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler before choosing MinMaxScaler.
Added columns for day of the week and month to improve accuracy.
Added lag features and moving averages because it wasn't predicting accurately.
Tried prophet and LSTM, finally using Bidirectional LSTM.
